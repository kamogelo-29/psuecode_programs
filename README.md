[-] To any one who is reading this.

[-] The current repository will be composed of programs written purely in psuedocode.

[-] The main aim of this activity is to display the following abilities and strengths.

   [*] Abstact Thinking - This is thinking in terms of logic, structure and flow.
   [*] Algorithmic Thinking - The ability to focus on a sequence of steps
   [*] Problem Decomposition - The ability to break problems and task into smaller tasks
   [*] Focusing on logic of the program.
   [*] Analytical and Planning - demonstrating th abilities to design a rogram by first planning and then executing later.
   [*] Debugging and Error Prevention - demonstrating preventive pproblem solving

[-] The key aim is to design clear, correct, and efficient solutions to a problem.
[-] Psuedocode encourages the idea of think before coding.
[-] Mainly focusing on logic over syntax.
[-] The idea of problem solving by breaking programs down into simple understandable steps.
[-] By doing this the end goal would be to ensure that programs are
   [*] Well Planned
   [*] Easy to understand
   [*] Reliable
   [*] Adaptable
