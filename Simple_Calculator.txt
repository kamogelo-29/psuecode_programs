The Project is: Build a simple Calculator
Story:
We have to ask a user to enter 3 input. 
One is the first number, second is the operator and third is the second number.
We have to create functions for each operator and return and display their results.
** The main challenge would be if user enters multiple operators one after the other
** When a user chains operations
like if there is more than one operator in an equation
For the chains of operation it works with evaluating the user input. 
Which would need to evaluate one expression or if there is a chain of expressions.
This changes the input factor***

Module Main:
	// Declare All variables
	Declare Real operand_1, operand_2, results = 0;
	Declare String operator;
	
	// Get user input
	Display "May you enter the first number: ";
	Input operand_1;
	
	Call operator_symbol(operator);
	
	Display "May you enter the second number: ";
	Input operand_2;
	
	// input validate
	// Yet to be known
	
	// Checking which operator was called
	Select operator:
		Case "plus":
			Call addition(operand_1, operand_2);
		Case "minus":
			Call subtraction(operand_1, operand_2);
		Case "divide":
			Call division(operand_1, operand_2);
		Case "multiply":
			Call multiplication(operand_1, operand_2);
	End Select
	
End Module

Module operator_symbol(String Ref operator):
	// This module presents the user with the options of the operators that they can use.
	// matches their choice to a function that will be called outside of this module.

	//Declare the local variables of the module
	Declare String symbol;
	
	// Get user input
	Display "The following are the operators you can use: ";
	Display "+ plus, / divide, * multiply, - minus: ";
	Display "Please enter the symbol for the operator you wish to use: ";
	Input symbol;

	// Now check the value of the symbol and execute the statements
	Select symbol:
		Case +:
			Set operator = "plus";
		Case -:
			Set operator = "minus";
		Case *:
			Set operator = "multiply";
		Case /:
			Set operator = "divide";
		Default:
			Display "The operator you have entered is invalid";
	End Select

	// A local variable to store the calculation results

	// make sure that the user does not divide by zero
	If operand_1 == 0 OR operand_2 == 0 Then:
